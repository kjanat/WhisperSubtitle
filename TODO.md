## Implemented Features:

- **Configuration Management:**
    - Implemented `Get-WhisperSubtitleConfig` and `Set-WhisperSubtitleConfig` cmdlets for flexible module configuration.
    - Module now loads and persists configuration from `ModuleConfig.json`.
    - Hardcoded paths for `BaseLocation`, `TempPath`, and `SubtitleEditPath` have been replaced with configurable options.
    - Added Pester tests for configuration cmdlets, ensuring their correct functionality.

- **Enhanced Error Handling and Logging:**
    - `Write-ModuleLog` function now supports logging exceptions, providing more detailed error information.
    - Integrated enhanced logging with exceptions across key functions (`Test-ModulePrerequisites`, `Get-VideoInformation`, `New-AudioFromVideo`, `Invoke-LegacyWhisper`, `Invoke-ModernWhisper`, `Optimize-SubtitleFile`).

- **Improved Progress Reporting:**
    - Replaced window title updates with standard PowerShell `Write-Progress` for better user feedback during subtitle generation.

## Remaining Tasks:

- **External Dependency Clarity:**
    - Further refine the distinction and handling of "legacy" vs. "modern" Whisper implementations within the code and documentation for improved clarity and robustness.

- **Comprehensive Pester Tests:**
    - Develop extensive Pester tests for `ConvertTo-Subtitle` to cover various scenarios, including different input types, languages, models, and error conditions.
    - Add Pester tests for all remaining helper functions to ensure their individual correctness and reliability.

- **`PassThru` Consistency:**
    - Refine the `PassThru` parameter behavior in `ConvertTo-Subtitle` to ensure it only outputs processed file information when explicitly specified, aligning with standard PowerShell cmdlet design principles.
