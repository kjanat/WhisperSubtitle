# TODO

Based on the current [README.md](README.md) and the previous error context, hereâ€™s what still needs
to be implemented or fixed to make this project truly bombastic and error-free:

1. **Module Code Linting & Syntax Fixes** (Completed)

    - The main module file ([WhisperSubtitle.psm1](WhisperSubtitle.psm1)) has been refactored to address syntax errors and improve clarity, including replacing the `UseOldWhisper` switch with a `WhisperImplementation` parameter.

2. **Automated Testing** (Completed)

    - Robust Pester tests have been implemented for all exported functions and helper functions in `Tests/WhisperSubtitle.Core.Tests.ps1` and `Tests/WhisperSubtitle.Config.Tests.ps1`.
    - Test cases cover various scenarios, including successful execution, error handling, and edge cases.


3. **Installation Automation** (Completed)

    - Created `Build/Install-Dependencies.ps1` to automate the installation of external dependencies (Python, Whisper, FFmpeg, PyTorch, Subtitle Edit).


4. **Error Handling & Logging** (Completed)

    - All user-facing functions now include clear, user-friendly error messages and consistent verbose logging, ensuring robust error handling throughout the module.

5. **Feature Documentation** (Completed)

    - Added a "Feature Matrix" to `README.md` to clearly show which features require which dependencies.

6. **Examples & Usage** (Completed)

    - Added comprehensive real-world usage examples to `Examples/Basic-Usage.ps1`, covering basic subtitle generation, batch processing, translation, error handling, and using the legacy Whisper implementation.

7. **Contribution & Development Guide** (Completed)

    - Created `CONTRIBUTING.md` to provide guidelines for new contributors, covering coding style, testing, documentation, and pull request process.

8. **Changelog Automation** (Completed)

    - Updated `CHANGELOG.md` with recent changes and added instructions to `CONTRIBUTING.md` on how to manually update the changelog, with a note on future automation plans.

9. **Module Manifest Updates** (Completed)

    - Ensured `WhisperSubtitle.psd1` is in sync with the latest version and exported functions from `WhisperSubtitle.psm1`.

10. **Optional: VS Code Tasks/Launch Config** (Completed)

    - Added `.vscode/tasks.json` for common development tasks and `.vscode/launch.json` for debugging configurations.

**Summary:**

The core PowerShell logic needs to be fixed and linted, tests and automation should be improved,
and developer/usage documentation can be expanded. Once the syntax errors are gone and tests pass,
this module will be unstoppable!

Let me know if you want a prioritized action plan or want to tackle a specific area first!
